Car Rental App

### Overview
This Car Rental App allows renters to manage their fleet of cars and handle reservations efficiently. 
The app focuses on the administration side, where the renter can add cars, update their availability, 
and manage reservations. The app is designed for internal use by the car rental company's administrative team.

### Features
- Manage Cars: Add, update, and remove cars from the fleet.
- Reservations: Book reservations for customers, update, and cancel bookings.
- Car Availability: Track which cars are available for reservation and which are currently booked.


### Tech Stack
- Backend: Django (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development).
